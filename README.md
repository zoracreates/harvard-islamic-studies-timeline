# Harvard Islamic Studies Timeline
This CSS and JavaScript timeline was implemented in Open Scholar for the [History of Islamic Studies at Harvard Website](https://timeline.islamicstudies.harvard.edu/).
I worked closely with the designer form the Islamic Studies deparment to determine what was possible within the website. Aside from the programming aspect,
I created mock ups to adjust their suggested designs to the web and the Open Scholar platform.

Website Goals
- A highly stylized easy to maintain Open Scholar timeline
- Ability to embed Sound Cloud
- Ability to jump through different periods of the department's history
- Ability to instert images for each timeline event
